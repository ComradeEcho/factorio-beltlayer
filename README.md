# Description

Ever wanted your underground belts to turn corners?

Ever wanted to run underground belts long distances without periodically popping up above ground?

Ever wondered why underground belts cost the same whether you run them under one tile or their full length?

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you need Beltlayer.

# How to use

1. Place down two Underground transport belt connectors of the desired belt speed, one at the entrance and one at the exit. Connectors are researched at the same time as the normal underground belts of the same speed. You can use any rotation for these connectors. Change the connectors between input and output with the rotation key (normally R).
2. As the description for the connector indicates, press CONTROL+B (rebindable) to show the editor interface. You will see the underground endpoints of the two connectors you placed. The editor interface carries over all passive transport belt entities (belts and normal underground belts; no splitters or loaders) that were in your inventory.
3. Place belts in the glorious freedom of the underground!
4. Profit!

# Caveats

Items are mixed randomly in the left and right lanes of output belts. This makes Beltlayer only usable with belts carrying the same item in both lanes. This is a limitation of Factorio's loader entities. This may be possible to change in 0.17 if these feature requests are implemented:
