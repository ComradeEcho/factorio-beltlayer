# Description

Ever wanted your underground belts to turn corners?

Ever wanted to run underground belts long distances without periodically popping up above ground?

Ever wondered why underground belts cost the same whether you run them under one tile or their full length?

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you need Beltlayer.

# How to use

1. Place down two Underground transport belt connectors of the desired belt speed, one at the entrance and one at the exit. Connectors are researched at the same time as the normal underground belts of the same speed. You can use any rotation for these connectors. Change the connectors between input and output with the rotation key (normally R).
2. As the description for the connector indicates, press CONTROL+B (rebindable) to show the editor interface. You will see the underground endpoints of the two connectors you placed. The editor interface carries over all passive transport belt entities (belts and normal underground belts; no splitters or loaders) that were in your inventory.
3. Place belts in the glorious freedom of the underground!
4. Profit!

# Caveats

1. Items are mixed randomly in the left and right lanes of output belts. This makes Beltlayer only usable with belts carrying the same item in both lanes. This is a limitation of Factorio's loader entities. This may be possible to change in 0.17 if these feature requests are implemented:

1. Blueprinting and deconstruction is implemented with Black Magic. There are almost certainly bugs. There are also a huge variety of possible scenarios in which you might encounter problems. Please report *exactly* what you did leading up to a bug, including:
    1. a screenshot showing the precise area selected with the blueprint or deconstruction tool,
    1. a screenshot of the below ground editor matching the above ground screenshot,
    1. the filter settings of the deconstruction tool, if applicable,
    1. a screenshot of the blueprint setup window, if applicable, and
    1. a description of what you expected to happen, and what happened instead.

# FAQ

> What's with the name of the mod?

A pipelayer is a person who installs ("lays down") pipes in underground areas. It is also a reference to the separate underground layer where the belts are routed.

> Isn't this a little bit cheaty?

Yes, it absolutely is! The straight-line and length limitations of standard underground belts are part of Factorio's design challenge, and overuse of this mod may result in an unintended shortage of spaghetti in your base. On the other hand, you still have to move items on the surface to split, balance, and route items into and out of assembling machines, so the potentional for abuse is somewhat limited.

Using this mod also introduces a new layer of complexity, where keeping track of where items are routed is no longer obvious just from looking at the surface. If you're not careful, you can make your own base layout very confusing to navigate.
